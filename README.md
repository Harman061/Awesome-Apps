Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Simple Notes App, a lightweight and modern note-taking app built with Flutter and Hive (for local, offline storage).
I built this project to create a clean, fast, and beginner-friendly example of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations â€” and to practice some cool new Flutter tricks too!

âœ¨ Features
Add, edit, and delete notes easily

Notes are saved offline with Hive (even after you close the app)

// ADDITIONAL STEPS APART FROM BASIC CRUD OPERATION
Swipe left to Edit or Delete notes (thanks to Flutter Slidable, a wonderful dependency I started using frequently)

Clean and modern UI with cards, bottom sheets, and smooth animations

Instant feedback with snackbars (because everyone loves a little feedback!)
